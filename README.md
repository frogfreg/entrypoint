entrypoint
==========

This repo will host the entry point for all of our instances.

The new version have been rewritten in Go, check the release section and download the latest version.

This is not a process manager, that's the [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) this means that if you want to add or modify
how processes are being managed use the proper supervisor configuration files.

Install from the build
--

The entry point can be installed automatically during the build stage of you image just add the following in your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrchestSh/entrypoint/master/installer.sh | sh
...
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/dumb-init", "--"]
CMD ["/entrypoint"]
```

This will download and deploy the entry_point in the ```/``` path 

Environment variables
--

The entry_point can be tuned using any of the following env vars:

```DEBUG_ENTRYPOINT```: Will log debug output and be more verbose

```AUTOSTART```: If False will set all the processed from supervisor to autostart false, if true basically won't change
anything because is assumed that all processes are autostart true by default

Configuring Odoo instance
--

The instance running inside can be configured using env vars just take in mind that they need to have the ```ODOORC_``` prefix.

```shell
ODOORC_DB_HOST=1.1.1.1
ODOORC_DB_USER=odoo
```

Those variables will be pased and replaced in the Odoo configuration file, you don't need to use uppercase
always, but is a good practice.

If the variable is not in the config file they will be added in the ```options``` section, if they are present in other
section they will be replaced there.

Sections in Odoo configuration file
--

Add the required files with the sections in ```/external_files/odoocfg``` and the entry_point will append them to the
default configuration file to replace the vaules with the env vars just add the ```ODOORC_``` prefix to the variable name
and will be replaced in the corresponding section
